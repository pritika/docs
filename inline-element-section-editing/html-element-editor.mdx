The Element Editor is an inline editing toolbar that appears whenever you click on an editable element, such as text, images, or buttons, within the website editor. It provides a floating interface to manage the content, appearance, and physical positioning of individual site components.

## Editing text and inline formatting

To change what a specific element says, use the text tools directly from the toolbar.

- **Inline editing**: Clicking the Pencil icon opens the Text Editor popup, where you can type or paste new text into a textarea to replace the element’s existing content.
- **Formatting selection**: If you highlight a specific portion of text within an element, formatting buttons appear for **Bold**, **Italic**, and **Underline**. Clicking these wraps the selected text in the corresponding HTML tags to apply the style locally.
- **Removing formats**: If an entire element is already formatted (for example, a bold header), clicking the highlighted format button strips the formatting and reverts the element to plain text.

## Adjusting typography and alignment

The Style Editor (the “A” icon) controls the technical properties of your text.

### Font properties

- **Font sizes**: Choose from pre-defined sizes such as Small, Body, or heading levels.
- **Font weights**: Select Light, Normal, Medium, or Bold.

### Case and alignment

- **Text case**: Use icon buttons to force UPPERCASE, lowercase, Capitalize, or Normal.
- **Text alignment**: Toggle alignment between Left, Centre, and Right.

### Colour

You can apply colours to:

- Text
- Element background

Use theme-synced colour circles or a manual colour picker.

## Applying visual effects

For advanced design adjustments, the Effects Editor (sparkle icon) lets you manipulate an element’s visual presence.

### Transforms

Use sliders to:

- **Rotate** up to 180 degrees
- **Scale** from 0.1× to 3×
- **Skew** along the X-axis

### Box shadows

Add depth using:

- Shadow presets (Small through Extra Large)
- Custom shadow controls (Offset X/Y, Blur, Spread)

### Reset

Use **Reset All Effects** to clear all transforms and shadows in one click.

## Controlling layout (margin and padding)

The Layout Editor (square icon) manages the space around and within an element.

### Simple mode

Two inputs let you adjust:

- **Vertical** spacing (top/bottom together)
- **Horizontal** spacing (left/right together)

This is useful for balanced spacing changes.

### Individual mode

Expands into four separate inputs for precise control:

- Top
- Right
- Bottom
- Left

### Border radius

A dedicated input lets you round corners equally by entering a pixel or unit value.

## Element operations: duplicating and styling

The toolbar includes one-click actions to speed up your workflow.

### Duplicating

Clicking the Duplicate icon (double-page symbol) creates an exact clone of the selected element (including its styles and children) and places it immediately after the original.

### Copy and paste styles

- **Copy Style** captures all computed styles of an element (for example, font, spacing, colours).
- **Paste Style** applies those captured visual attributes to a different selected element.

## Analogy for the Element Editor

Think of the Element Editor like a stylist’s kit for a photo shoot:

- Text editing is like changing the script for a model to hold.
- Typography and styles are like choosing the font for their name tag.
- Layout and spacing act like a stage manager deciding how much room is between the model and the background (margins) or how tight their clothing fits (padding).
- Duplicating and copy-pasting styles is like having a “magic camera” that can instantly replicate a specific look or outfit and put it on another person with a single click.
