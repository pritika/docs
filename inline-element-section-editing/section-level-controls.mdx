title: Section-Level Controls
description: Regenerate sections, edit embeds, and manage section backgrounds.
---

Section-level controls are managed through the Section Editor, a comprehensive tabbed dialog used to modify entire website blocks rather than individual elements. You can access these tools by hovering over a section in the editor and clicking **Edit Section** (pencil icon) or **Edit Images** (image icon).

## Regenerating sections with AI

The **Edit with AI** tab lets you redesign a section using specific text instructions.

### Prompting

You can enter prompts of up to **500 characters** to request specific changes, for example:

- “Make heading larger and bold”
- “Add a Learn More button at the bottom”

### Credit system

This feature uses the AI credit system:

- A badge in the tab displays your current balance
- The system warns you if your limit has been reached

### Process

After you submit a prompt:

- The section shows a loading spinner while the AI processes regeneration
- The section updates automatically with new code and layout

## Editing YouTube and iframe embeds

If a section contains `<iframe>` elements (for example, videos or maps), they are managed via the **IFrames** tab.

### Detection

The editor automatically identifies iframes and displays them as cards with:

- A preview
- A source URL

### YouTube auto-convert

If you paste a standard YouTube URL, the editor automatically:

- Extracts the video ID
- Converts the URL to the required embed format:
  - `https://www.youtube.com/embed/{VIDEO_ID}`

This ensures the video plays correctly on your site.

### Management and saving

You can update URLs or remove embeds entirely. Changes are only finalised once you click the main **Save** button on the dialog.

## Modifying backgrounds and bulk images

The Section Editor provides centralised control over the visual theme and media within a block.

### Section backgrounds

Under the **Style** tab, you can modify the **Background Colour** for the entire section using:

- Pre-set theme colours
- A hex code
- A manual colour picker

### Bulk image management

The **Image** tab provides a grid view of every image used in the section, including standard image tags and background images.

- **Replacement**: Replace images in bulk by using the individual **Edit Image** buttons.
- **Sourcing**: New images can be sourced via:
  - File uploads (up to **10MB**)
  - Unsplash searches
  - AI-generated images (from within the section dialog)

## Analogy for section-level controls (Stage set)

Think of a section as a **stage set** in a theatre:

- Regenerating with AI is like giving the stage director a specific instruction to “make the scene more dramatic,” and the AI instantly rearranges furniture and props to match.
- IFrame/YouTube editing is like swapping out the television set on stage for a different model or changing the channel it’s playing.
- Background and bulk editing is like the set designer painting the back wall a new colour or swapping out every framed photo on the set at once to change the theme of the room.
