Managing the interactive and visual elements of your website is handled through the Media & Links tools within the inline Element Editor. This system allows you to define how users navigate your site and how your products or brand are visually presented.

## Connecting elements (link management)

You can turn text or entire components into interactive triggers using the Link Editor (🔗 icon) on the floating toolbar.

### External URLs

Connect elements to any website by pasting a URL. The system automatically adds the required `https://` prefix if it is missing.

### Internal pages

Select from your existing site structure to route visitors to pages like “About Us” or “Services”.

### Email & phone triggers

You can create:

- A **mailto** link that opens the visitor’s default email app
- A **tel** link that triggers a phone dialler on mobile devices

These triggers are automatically set to open in the same window to ensure the native device application launches correctly.

### Scroll to section

For single-page sites or long landing pages, you can link an element to a specific **Section Number**, allowing users to jump directly to content like “Pricing” or “FAQ”.

### Targeting

You can choose whether a link opens in:

- The same window (`_self`)
- A new tab (`_blank`) — the system automatically includes the necessary security attributes

### Creating links

Depending on what you’re editing, you can:

- Wrap specific highlighted text in a link
- Convert an entire non-interactive element (like an icon) into a clickable anchor

## Replacing images

The Image Editor (🖼️ icon) provides three ways to source and replace media for your site—whether it’s a standard `<img>` element or a background image.

### File upload

- **Formats**: JPG, PNG, SVG
- **Max size**: 10MB
- **Performance**: Files over **0.5MB** are automatically compressed to help maintain site speed

### Unsplash search

Search and select professional stock photography directly within the editor. Selecting an image automatically handles the required photographer attribution.

### AI generation

Provide a text description (for example, “A modern office with natural lighting”) and the AI generates a unique, professional image for your site.

## Adjusting image filters and fit

Once an image is selected, the **Adjust** tab lets you fine-tune its appearance and how it sits within its container.

### Image fit modes

- **Cover**: Fills the container (image may be cropped).
- **Contain**: Shows the full image within the box (may leave empty gaps).
- **Fill**: Stretches the image to match the container dimensions.

### Visual filters

Use sliders to adjust:

- Brightness
- Contrast
- Grayscale
- Sepia
- Blur

If needed, use **Reset All Filters** to return to the original image state instantly.

## Analogy for media & links (Physical gallery)

Think of your website as a **physical gallery**:

- Connecting links is like putting up directional signs—some lead to other rooms (internal pages), while others provide a telephone or envelope (phone/email triggers) for visitors to contact you.
- Replacing media is like changing the paintings on the wall—you can hang your own photo (upload), pick one from a professional archive (Unsplash), or describe a scene to a digital artist and have them paint it for you (AI generation).
- Filters and fit are like the lighting and framing of that painting, ensuring it fits the wall perfectly and has the right mood.
