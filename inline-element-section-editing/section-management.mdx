## Understanding sections

### What are sections?

Sections are the building blocks of your website. Each section is a distinct part of your page, for example:

- Hero / banner (your main header area with a title and call-to-action)
- About us
- Services
- Testimonials
- Contact form
- Footer
- Custom sections generated with AI

### How sections work

- Pages are made up of multiple sections stacked vertically.
- Each section has controls that appear when you hover over it.
- Sections can be added, edited, moved, hidden, duplicated, or deleted.
- Changes can be saved as drafts before you publish.

---

## Accessing section controls

### Finding the controls

1. Open your website in **Edit** mode (not Live/Preview).
2. Hover over a section.
3. Section outlines and controls appear.

### Control locations

**Top-right corner (main controls)** may include:

- Regenerate layout
- Change colors
- Edit images
- Edit content
- Regenerate with AI
- Duplicate
- Copy to page (multi-page)
- Move up / down
- Show / hide
- Delete

**Orange line (between sections)** may include:

- Add section
- Build with AI

**Left-side badge (draft status)** may include:

- Draft indicator
- Publish and undo controls (on hover)

---

## Adding new sections

### Method 1: Section gallery (templates)

1. Hover a section.
2. Use the orange line above or below and click **Add section**.
3. In the gallery modal, browse templates (hero, about, services, portfolio, contact, newsletter, etc.).
4. Click a template to add it immediately.

Best for:

- Fast, professional layouts
- Consistent design across your site
- Standard website blocks

### Method 2: Build with AI

1. Hover a section.
2. Use the orange line above or below and click **Build with AI**.
3. Describe what you want in natural language.
4. AI generates a custom section and inserts it where you chose.

Examples:

- “Create a pricing table with 3 tiers”
- “Add a team section with 4 members”
- “Make a FAQ section about shipping”
- “Build a gallery showing my products”

### Where sections appear

- **Top line**: inserts a section above the current section.
- **Bottom line**: inserts a section below the current section.

### Notes

- The first (hero) section may restrict adding above it.
- The footer stays at the bottom.
- The number of sections you can add may depend on your plan.

---

## Building with AI

AI section creation lets you describe what you want and have it built automatically.

### How to use the AI section builder

1. Click **Build with AI** on an orange add line (or use ChatAI in the sidebar).
2. Write a specific prompt:
   - Content type (“pricing table”, “FAQ”, “testimonials”)
   - Number of items (“3 plans”, “6 FAQs”)
   - Style preferences (“modern”, “minimal”, “colorful”)
   - Any must-have text or features
3. Wait for generation (often 10–30 seconds).
4. Review and refine:
   - Edit details with the inline editor
   - Regenerate with better instructions if needed

### Prompt examples

Good prompts:

- “Create a 3-column services section with icons, titles, and descriptions”
- “Add a testimonial carousel with 5 customer reviews”
- “Build a hero section with a call-to-action button and background image”
- “Make a contact form with name, email, message, and submit button”

Less effective prompts:

- “Add something nice”
- “Make it better”
- “Section”

### Credits

- AI generation uses credits.
- Your available credits depend on your plan and refresh cadence.

## Section appearance controls

### Regenerate section layout

Changes the layout/design while keeping your content.

1. Hover the section.
2. Click **Regenerate layout** (circular arrow).
3. Wait for regeneration.
4. Click again to cycle to another layout.

Typically changes:

- Element arrangement and spacing
- Overall structure

Typically keeps:

- Your section content (text/images)
- Section type

### Regenerate color theme

Changes the color palette for the section.

1. Hover the section.
2. Click **Change colors** (palette icon).
3. Cycle through variants until you like one.

Tips:

- Use contrast to create hierarchy (for example, darker CTA sections).
- Alternate light and dark sections for rhythm.

---

## Editing section content

### Edit section (text & elements)

2. Click **Edit content** (pencil icon).
3. Click any element within the section to edit it.

You can edit:

### Edit images

If the section contains images (including background images):

1. Hover the section.
2. Click **Edit images** (image icon).
3. Select the image to modify and replace/upload/reposition/remove as needed.

### Regenerate section with AI

Rebuilds the section using AI instructions.

1. Hover the section.
2. Click **Regenerate with AI** (sparkles/refresh).
3. Optionally add instructions (for example: “Make it more professional”, “Change to 3 columns”).
4. Regenerate and review.

Important:

- This recreates the section and may replace existing content.
- AI usage consumes credits.

---

## Duplicating sections

### Duplicate on the same page

Creates an exact copy of the section, usually inserted below the original.

1. Hover the section.
2. Click **Duplicate**.
3. Wait a few seconds for processing.

Duplicates typically include:

- Some hero sections may be fixed at the top.

### Move down

1. Hover the section.
2. Click **Move down** (down arrow).

Notes:

- The footer typically can’t move down and stays last.

### Suggested page flow

5. Testimonials / social proof
6. Pricing (optional)
7. Call-to-action
8. Contact info
9. Footer

---

## Visibility controls

### Show / hide sections

Hide a section to remove it from the live site without deleting it.

To hide:

1. Hover the section.
2. Click **Hide** (eye icon).

To show:

1. Hover the hidden (faded) section.
2. Click **Show** (eye-with-slash icon).

Indicators:

- In edit mode, hidden sections often appear faded (reduced opacity).
- On the live site, hidden sections do not render or take up space.

Best practice:

- Prefer **hiding** over deleting unless you’re certain you won’t need the section again.

---

## Deleting sections

### How to delete

1. Hover the section.
2. Click **Delete** (trash icon).
3. Confirm deletion.

Warnings:

- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
- Some structural sections may be protected (for example: hero/navbar/footer).

Before deleting:

- Hide it first (safer).
- Duplicate it as a backup.
- Copy important text/images elsewhere.

---

## Draft & publish system

### Drafts

A draft is a saved change that is not live yet.

You may see a **Draft** badge on the left side of a section when it has unpublished edits.

### Publish options

**Publish an individual section**

1. Hover the section’s Draft badge.
2. Click **Publish** (upload icon).
3. Confirm.

**Publish the entire page**

1. Use the bottom save/publish bar.
2. Click **Publish page** (or similar).
3. Confirm publishing all unpublished sections.

### Undo / revert

**Undo a section’s draft**

1. Hover the Draft badge.
2. Click **Undo** (back arrow).
3. Confirm discard to revert to the published version.

**Discard all page changes**

Use the bottom bar to discard all unpublished changes on the page.

---

## Multi-page features

### Copy section to another page

Requirements:

- Multi-page enabled
- At least 2 pages

How it works:

1. Hover the section.
2. Click **Copy to another page**.
3. Choose a target page.
4. The section is added to the end of the target page, and you may be redirected.

Notes:

- Copies are independent: editing the original doesn’t update the copy (and vice versa).

---

## Best practices

### Organization

- Keep a strong hero first.
- Use a logical story flow from top to bottom.
- Place calls-to-action where they naturally fit.
- Keep the footer last.

### Performance

- Use appropriately sized, compressed images.
- Avoid excessive section count and heavy effects.
- Test on mobile for readability, spacing, and tap targets.

### Workflow

- Add sections first, then fill in content, then refine styling.
- Use drafts while iterating; publish when a section is ready.
- Hide sections for experiments; delete only when you’re sure.

### Consistency

- Stick to theme colors where possible.
- Keep typography consistent (headings/body hierarchy).
- Use consistent spacing and alignment patterns.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Section controls not appearing

- Ensure you’re in **Edit** mode.
- Hover directly over the section content.
- Close any open modals/panels.
- Refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R) and try again.

### Can’t move a section

- The section may be at the top/bottom limit.
- The section may be protected (hero/footer).
- Refresh and try again if controls look stuck.

### Duplicate not working

- Wait a few seconds (larger sections take longer).
- Check your connection and retry.
- If AI-based duplication/regeneration is involved, confirm you have credits.

### Draft not publishing

- Retry publishing after a refresh.
- Confirm your session hasn’t expired.
- Check permissions if you’re in a team workspace.

### AI generation failed

- Check credit balance.
- Simplify the prompt and try again.
- Retry later if it appears to be a temporary error.
