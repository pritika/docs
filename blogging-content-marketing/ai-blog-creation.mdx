Butternut AI uses a multi-step guided wizard to transform your ideas into professional, SEO-optimised blog posts. This process begins by defining the intent of your article within the `DescribeBlog` component.

## Defining blog topics and SEO keywords

The foundation of your article is built on the specific topic and keywords you provide to the AI.

- **Blog topic (idea)**: Enter a clear description of what the blog is about in the IDEA text area. This becomes the primary context for the AI “professional blog writer assistant”.
- **SEO keywords**: Provide a comma-separated list of keywords. These guide the AI in generating five SEO-friendly title suggestions and help ensure the content is discoverable by search engines.

## Setting brand voice and context

To ensure the blog aligns with your business identity, you can customise tone and brand integration.

- **Brand context**: Toggle whether the AI should include your Organisation Name (`org_name`) and specific business context in the generation.
- **Brand voice**: Select from a multi-select list of tones to define how the article reads, including:
  - Friendly
  - Professional
  - Witty
  - Heartfelt
  - Educational

## Targeting specific audiences

Style targeting helps narrow the focus of the blog to reach a specific demographic.

### Gender and age

- **Gender**: Male, Female, or Both
- **Age groups**: 18–25 up to 45+, or select **All** for broader reach

### Location targeting

For region-specific businesses, use the tag-based interface to add multiple locations. This helps the AI make the content more locally relevant.

## Cost and next steps

- **Credits**: Starting the blog creation process debits **1 AI credit** from your account balance.
- **Workflow**: After submitting these details via `POST /article-details`, the system proceeds to Step 2 and generates **five** unique title suggestions (with SEO explanations) that you can review or regenerate.

## Analogy for AI blog creation (Freelance journalist).

Think of this process as briefing a freelance journalist:

- Providing the topic and keywords is like giving them the headline and the research notes.
- Selecting the brand voice is like telling them whether to wear a suit (Professional) or a t-shirt (Friendly) while writing.
- Defining the audience and location is like handing them a map and a photo of your ideal customer so they know exactly who they are speaking to before they ever put pen to paper.
