The Editorial Workflow is a guided, multi-step process that allows you to refine the AI’s content plan before the full article is generated. This stage ensures that the final blog post aligns with your specific vision and SEO goals.

## Managing AI title suggestions

After you define your blog topic, the AI proposes **five** SEO-friendly titles. Each title card includes a short explanation of why it was chosen.

### Selecting a title

Browse the title cards and click your preferred option to highlight it for the next stage of generation.

### Editing a title

If a suggestion is almost perfect:

1. Click the edit icon to open an inline input field.
2. Modify the title text.
3. Click **Save** to update the article data.

### Regenerating a title

If you’re unsatisfied with a specific suggestion:

- Click the regenerate icon on that title card.
- The system calls the AI to produce a replacement title that is not already in your list.

During regeneration, the card blurs to indicate the AI is working.

## Shaping the article outline (paragraph headings)

After selecting a title, the AI proposes an outline consisting of paragraph headings. This outline acts as the structural skeleton of your blog post.

### Adding new headings

- Click **+ Add paragraph header** to expand your outline.
- The system generates a new heading and inserts it at the top of your list.

**Note:** There is a maximum limit of **six** headings per article.

### Reordering headings

To change the narrative flow:

- Use the up and down arrow buttons on each heading card.

This moves the heading within the `paragraph_suggestions` array, ensuring content is generated in your preferred sequence.

### Editing and regenerating headings

- Click the edit icon to modify heading text inline.
- Click the regenerate icon to replace a specific heading with a new AI-generated suggestion.

### Deleting headings

If a heading doesn’t fit your outline, click the trash icon to remove it permanently from the article data.

## Reviewing suggested keywords

Alongside the headings, the AI provides suggested keywords (typically three short-tail and two long-tail). You can manually edit these in the comma-separated text area so the AI focuses on the terms you want to rank for during the final generation phase.

## Analogy for the editorial workflow (Professional ghostwriter)

Think of this workflow as collaborating with a professional ghostwriter:

- Selecting and editing the title is like agreeing on the front cover of a book.
- Shaping the paragraph headings is like reviewing the table of contents together—you can add chapters, swap their order, or rewrite their titles until you’re happy with the story’s structure.

Only once you’ve signed off on this outline does the writer go away to produce the full manuscript.
