Article Management within Butternut allows you to control the lifecycle of your blog content, from the initial AI-generated draft to its final publication and subsequent updates. These tools are primarily found within the **Blog** section of the website editor’s sidebar.

## Managing article status (Draft vs Published)

Articles have two primary visibility states that determine whether they are accessible to your website visitors.

### Initial generation

When an article is first created using the AI workflow, the system sets it to **Published** automatically once content generation and image validation are complete.

### Manual toggling

Within the Blog sidebar, you can view a list of posts and their current status (**Published** or **Draft**). You can toggle this status manually:

- **Draft**: Hidden from the live website
- **Published**: Visible in the public feed

### Visibility control

This allows you to prepare content in advance or temporarily remove a post from public view for revisions without deleting it.

## Soft-deletes and re-enabling articles

Butternut uses a soft-delete system so content isn’t accidentally lost forever when removed from the dashboard.

### The soft-delete process

Clicking the trash icon on an article card triggers a soft-delete using the `is_deleted` flag in the database. This hides the article from:

- The dashboard list
- The public website

The document is not permanently erased.

### Re-enabling content

Because the document remains in the database, hidden articles can be re-enabled via the dashboard by reverting the delete flag, making the content manageable again.

### Note on blog page deletion

Individual articles use soft-delete. However, deleting an entire **Blog Page** permanently removes the page and all associated articles from the site.

## Editing article data and metadata

You can refine articles at any time to improve SEO or update information through the dedicated Article Editor.

### Accessing the editor

Click an article card in the sidebar to open the editor (typically at a URL like `/dashboard/[websiteId]/blog/[articleId]`).

### Modifiable fields

- **Content**: Edit the main blog text and subheading HTML snippets.
- **Metadata**: Update the Title, SEO Keywords, and Slug (the URL path).
- **Visuals**: Replace or update images attached to specific sections of the article.

### Saving changes

When you edit these fields, the system performs `POST /edit-article-data` to update the JSON payload in the database, ensuring changes are persisted and reflected in the site’s metadata.

## Analogy for article management (Public noticeboard)

Think of your blog as a public noticeboard:

- Managing status is like deciding whether to keep a notice pinned to the front (Published) or keep it in your folder (Draft) where only you can see it.
- A soft-delete is like taking a notice down and putting it in a “Records” drawer—it’s gone from the board, but you can pin it back up whenever you like.
- Editing metadata is like updating the headline or the reference number on the notice so people can find the right information easily.
