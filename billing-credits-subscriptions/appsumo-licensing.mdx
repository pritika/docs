As part of your Account, Security, and Billing Management, AppSumo licensing provides a way to activate websites and gain AI credits without a traditional recurring subscription.

## Redeeming and linking AppSumo license keys

The redemption process is handled through a secure OAuth workflow that connects your AppSumo purchase to your Butternut account.

### OAuth exchange

When you redeem your code, the system performs an OAuth exchange to obtain a temporary token and fetch your specific license key.

### Account association

- **Key already linked**: If the license key is already linked to an existing Butternut user, the system logs you into that account.
- **New key**: If the key is new, a license record is created in the `appsumo_license` collection, storing your license key, status (inactive/active), and tier.

### Tier-based benefits

Your AppSumo tier determines:

- Domain limits
- The size of your one-time AI credit bundle

### One-time AI credits

Once your license is active and linked to your user ID, the system grants a **one-time** grant of AI credits based on your tier (as long as you haven’t been credited previously).

## Utilising license credits to activate websites

Once a license is linked to your account, you can use it to activate websites, moving them from a restricted/deactivated state to a fully functional live state.

### Activation workflow

You can attempt to activate a specific site through the authorised endpoint:

- `POST /utilise-license-credits`

Provide the `website_id` for the site you want to activate.

### Eligibility & exclusions

- **Portfolio sites excluded**: AppSumo licenses cannot be used to activate single-page “portfolio” style sites. These sites are explicitly excluded from the AppSumo activation flow.
- **Tier capacity enforced**: The system checks your domain limits (defined by your tier) against the number of websites already activated with that license.

### What happens during activation

When a website is successfully activated using a license:

- The website configuration is updated with the `license_key` and marked as **active**
- Any existing Stripe subscription fields are cleared to prevent double-billing
- Previously deactivated pages are restored, making site content accessible again

### Error handling

If you attempt to activate more websites than your tier allows, the system returns:

- **“Appsumo License limit exceeded”**

## Analogy for AppSumo licensing (Car club membership card)

Think of an AppSumo license like a **lifetime membership card** for a car club:

- Redeeming and linking is like visiting the club office to register your card and prove you bought it.
- Utilising credits is like deciding which of your cars in the garage gets a **permit sticker**.
  - Your membership tier decides if you get 1, 3, or 10 stickers.
  - You can place a sticker on any standard car to make it road-legal (Active), but the club rules state these stickers don’t work on motorcycles (portfolio sites).
