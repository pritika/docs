Based on the sources, the AI Credits System is the engine that powers AI-driven features across the Butternut platform, such as website generation, content creation, and social media automation. As previously categorised, this system is a core component of your Account, Security, and Billing Management.

## Monitoring credit balances & history

The system uses a simple mental model to track your credits:

- **Balance**: Total credits assigned or purchased
- **Used credits**: Credits consumed

### Credit balance cards

In your Credits Manager dashboard, you’ll typically see two primary indicators:

- **Current Balance (Green)**: Displays your remaining credits available for use (calculated as Total Balance − Used Credits).
- **Used Credits (Orange)**: Shows the total volume of credits already consumed, often expressed as a percentage of your total allocation.

### Transaction history

Every credit action is logged in a detailed table, including:

- Date
- Description of the action (for example, “Website generation”)
- Amount added or debited

### Website-specific tracking

If a specific website triggered the credit usage, the history table includes a link to that website, allowing you to audit which projects are consuming the most resources.

## Purchasing one-time credit packages

When your balance is low, you can purchase one-time credit bundles to continue using AI features.

### Available packages

Typical bundles range from **10,000 credits ($10)** up to **250,000 credits ($180)**.

### Purchase process

1. Open the **Add Credits** dialog in the dashboard.
2. Select your desired package.
3. Choose a saved payment method or enter a new one.
4. The system uses Stripe to process the transaction.
   - If your bank requires **3D Secure** authentication, a prompt will appear to complete the security check.

### Instant delivery

Once the payment is marked as **succeeded** by Stripe:

- Credits are added to your balance immediately
- Your running balance updates right away

## Managing payment methods

Butternut allows you to store multiple cards for “one-click” credit purchases. All card data is handled securely through **Stripe Elements**, ensuring the platform never stores your full card details.

### Adding a card

Click **Add Payment Method** to open a secure form. After entering the card number, expiry, and CVC, the card is tokenized and saved to your account for future use.

### Setting a default method

You can have multiple cards on file but must designate one as the **Default**. This card will be pre-selected for all future credit purchases.

### Deleting a card

To remove an old or expired card, select **Delete** next to the specific payment method. You will be asked for confirmation before the card is permanently detached from your account.

## Analogy for the AI Credits System (Pre-paid travel card)

Think of your AI Credits like a **pre-paid travel card**:

- **Current Balance** is the money you have left to spend on fares (website features).
- **Used Credits** is your digital receipt book showing where you’ve travelled.
- Purchasing packages is like topping up your card at a station kiosk.
- Managing payment methods is like choosing which credit card is linked to your “one-tap” payment feature.
