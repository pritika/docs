Managing your website’s domain is a critical step in moving from the editor to a live public presence. These settings are primarily controlled by the `website_config` record, which acts as a state machine tracking whether a domain is requested, verified, and secured with SSL.

## Linking custom domains and DNS verification

To use a domain you already own, link it to your Butternut account and verify your DNS configuration.

### Linking a domain

- Request to link a domain (for example, `example.com`).
- The system normalises the input by:
  - Lowercasing it
  - Stripping any leading `www`
- Once requested, the domain is stored as `req_domain` with `verified = False`.

### DNS A-record verification

After pointing your domain’s A-record to the Butternut server’s public IP at your registrar, trigger the verification check.

### Automated go-live

If the system resolves the A-record to the correct IP, it:

- Marks the domain as verified
- Moves the value from `req_domain` to the active domain field
- Automatically configures Nginx routing so your site is reachable

## Butternut-managed subdomains

For users on specific plans (such as Portfolio or free tiers), Butternut can create a managed subdomain (for example, `yourbrand.butternut.ai`).

### Requesting a subdomain

When you request a subdomain, the system:

- Checks that it isn’t already in use
- Uses AWS Route53 to create A-records for both the root and `www` versions

### Automated setup and preview

- After a **60-second** propagation buffer, the system runs an automatic verification pipeline.
- Once live, a headless browser captures a screenshot of the new subdomain to generate a preview card in your dashboard.

## SSL certificates (provisioning & regeneration)

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) ensures your site serves content over HTTPS.

### Automatic provisioning

Immediately after a custom domain or subdomain is verified, the system runs a script to generate an SSL certificate. Success is tracked by `ssl_generated = True`.

### Manual regeneration

If you encounter HTTPS/security errors or need to refresh the certificate, you can manually trigger SSL regeneration. This forces the system to re-run the provisioning script for the active domain.

## Unlinking and removing domains

If you need to change your web address or stop using a domain, the editor provides several unlinking options.

### Unlinking an active domain

Unlinking sets the active domain to `None` but preserves `req_domain` so you can reference or re-verify it later.

### Clearing live domains

A more permanent “protected” unlinking option clears the live domain field entirely.

### Removing requested domains

If you made a typo or changed your mind about a pending connection, remove the requested domain to clear `req_domain` and reset verification status.

## Analogy for domain management (House and address)

Think of your website as a house and the domain as its address:

- Linking a domain is like telling the post office where you want your mail delivered.
- DNS verification is the post office checking that the signpost (A-record) on your street actually points to your front door.
- SSL is the security key that ensures only safe, encrypted mail can get through.
- Unlinking is like taking your name off the letterbox when you decide to move.
