title: Team Collaboration
description: Invite sub-users, manage permissions, and control access.
---

Team Collaboration allows account owners to share access to their websites with team members while maintaining strict control over what each member can see or change.

## Inviting sub-users to an account

### Invitation process

Owners can invite a sub-user by entering their email address.

### What happens behind the scenes

- **Account detection**: If the invited person already has a Butternut account, the system uses their existing user ID.
- **New users**: If they are new, the system creates a “bare user” with a pending authentication status.

### Onboarding email

The system automatically sends an invite email containing a unique onboarding URL to the sub-user.

---

## Accepting or rejecting invites

### Accepting an invite

To accept, the sub-user must sign up or log in through the link provided in the invitation email.

Upon successful authentication, the system calls `accept_subuser_invite` to mark the relationship as **active**.

### Accessing owner accounts

Once the invite is accepted, the sub-user can:

- View a list of all owner accounts they have permission to access
- Switch into those account contexts

### Invite metadata (pre-accept)

Before accepting, users can view invite metadata on the landing page, which identifies the owner’s email and account details.

## Assigning per-website permissions

Permissions are assigned as a set of boolean capabilities for each specific website.

### Core permission keys

- **Edit Website**: Allows modifications to the site design and structure.
- **Edit Blogs**: Grants access to the blog editor.
  - This can only be enabled if the website already contains a blog page; otherwise, the system will return an error.
- **Link Domain**: Permits the sub-user to manage custom domain settings and DNS verification.
- **Settings**: Grants access to general website and configuration settings.

### Reviewing granted permissions

Owners can fetch and review all permissions they have granted to a specific sub-user to ensure their team has the correct level of access.

---

## Revoking or deleting access and permissions

Owners have two ways to remove access depending on the required level of restriction:

### Granular revocation (per website)

Owners can remove permissions for one specific website only, allowing the sub-user to retain access to other sites under the same account.

### Total deletion (remove sub-user)

Removing a sub-user entirely will:

- Immediately revoke all access
- Delete every permission record associated with that sub-user for the owner’s account

Once deleted, the owner’s account will no longer appear in the sub-user’s “accessible accounts” list.

## Analogy for team collaboration (Corporate HQ)

Think of your Butternut account as a **Corporate Headquarters**. You are the Building Owner with a master key.

When you invite a sub-user, you are issuing them a **Digital Keycard**. You can program that keycard to only open specific doors—such as the Marketing Office (Edit Blogs) or the Server Room (Link Domain).

If you want to change their duties, you can reprogram their card for a single room, or you can deactivate the card entirely to remove their access to the building.
