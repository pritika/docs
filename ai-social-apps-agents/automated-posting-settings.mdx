Automated posting settings allow you to define the operational parameters for your AI Agents, ensuring that generated social media content aligns with your brand's voice and reaches your audience at the right time. These configurations are managed within the **Settings** tab of your installed social app.

## Configuring AI tone, language, and audience

To ensure the AI produces relevant captions and media, define the “personality” of your posts.

### Tone of voice

Choose from predefined personas such as:

- Professional
- Casual
- Friendly
- Authoritative

### Language

Set the primary language for your posts (for example, English, Spanish, or French) to match your local or global market.

### Target audience and geographic focus

Provide details on who the content is for and where they are located. This helps the AI tailor references and cultural nuances to specific regions or demographics.

### Custom instructions

Add a text-based brief to guide the AI’s creative output (for example, “Focus on sustainability” or “Mention our current 20% discount”).

## Setting frequency, time slots, and time zones

Consistency is key to social media growth. These settings automate your posting calendar.

### Posting frequency

Select how often you want the AI to publish. Common options include:

- Daily
- 3× per week
- Weekly
- Bi-weekly

### Time slots

Choose a general window for publication, such as:

- Morning
- Afternoon
- Evening
- Night

### Time zone

Select your timezone so the system triggers the “process due posts” function at the correct local time.

### Queue management

The system typically aims to maintain a target of **five** future scheduled posts at any given time to ensure your queue never runs dry.

## Adjusting the content mix

To prevent your feed from becoming repetitive, you can adjust the balance of different post types using percentage-based controls.

- **Industry news**: Educational content and external trends to build authority.
- **Company updates**: Internal news, product launches, or team highlights.
- **Thought leadership**: Insights and unique perspectives to engage followers.

### Customisation

Manually set your mix (for example, 40% News, 30% Updates, 30% Leadership) to match your current marketing strategy.

---

## Activating the agent

1. Click **Save Settings** to store your configuration.
2. Switch the **Activation** toggle to **ON** to begin automation.

If you select the `should_post` option during setup, the backend will immediately trigger a background thread to generate your initial batch of scheduled posts.

## Analogy for automated posting (Marketing brief)

Think of Automated Posting Settings as a marketing brief you hand to a new employee:

- Tone and audience define your brand’s personality and who your customers are.
- Frequency and time slots act like their work schedule—telling them when to show up and post.
- Content mix is their editorial calendar—ensuring a healthy variety of news and insights so the audience stays interested.
