The Queue Management system allows you to oversee and control the content generated by AI Agents before it goes live on your social media profiles. Manage upcoming content from the **Posts** tab within the specific app configuration page in your dashboard.

## Previewing and managing upcoming posts

The posting queue consists of records in the `scheduled_posts` database, which tracks what will be published and when.

### Viewing the queue

In the Posts tab, you can see a list of upcoming content. Each entry typically shows:

- Caption text
- Associated images (if any)
- Scheduled time (`scheduleAt`)
- Current status (for example, `scheduled`, `published`, or `failed`)

### Filtering

You can filter posts for a specific website or social platform using `social_credential_id`.

### Editing content

If a caption or image doesn’t meet your requirements, you can edit the post to:

- Modify the text content
- Swap image URLs
- Toggle the `is_active` flag off to pause a post without deleting it

### Deleting posts

To permanently remove a post from the queue, click the trash icon. This deletes the post record from the database.

## Manual triggers and immediate publishing

The system processes due posts automatically based on your frequency settings, but you can bypass the schedule for urgent updates.

### Publish immediately

Select **Publish** to send a post live right away. When triggered:

- The system fetches your social media credentials
- Sends the content to the platform (Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn)
- Updates the post status to `published` (or `failed` if an error occurs)

### Instagram Story sharing

For Instagram, you can publish a post as a Story. This uses the first image in the post’s image list and publishes it to your Instagram Story immediately.

### Manual generation

If your queue is empty—or you want fresh options—you can manually trigger the AI to generate new posts immediately. Newly generated posts then appear in the Posts tab for review.

## Analogy for queue management (Editor-in-Chief)

Managing your social media queue is like being the editor-in-chief of a magazine:

- Your AI Agent is the writer who prepares several articles (scheduled posts) in advance and puts them on your desk.
- You can preview their work, edit drafts, or throw away anything that doesn’t fit the brand.
- While most articles are set to print on a specific date, you still have the “stop the press” power to publish immediately—or send a highlight to the front page bulletin (Instagram Story) at a moment’s notice.
