Connect your own custom domain (for example, `yourcompany.com`) to your Butternut website.

## Prerequisites

- **Paid subscription** (not available on free plan)
- **Admin access**
- Access to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)

## How to access

1. Open your dashboard.
2. Click **Domains** in the navigation menu.

## Connect your domain

### Step 1: Enter domain information

1. **Email**: enter your email address.
2. **Website ID**: enter your website ID (found in your dashboard).
3. **Domain name**: enter your domain (for example, `example.com`).
   - Don’t include `www.`
   - Don’t include `https://` or `http://`
4. Click **Link Domain**.

### Step 2: Configure DNS records

After linking, add the required DNS records at your domain registrar.

Add these **A records**:

| Type | Name | Value                                |
| ---- | ---- | ------------------------------------ |
| A    | @    | (IP address shown in your dashboard) |
| A    | www  | (IP address shown in your dashboard) |

Where to add them (common registrars):

- GoDaddy: Domain Settings → Manage DNS
- Namecheap: Domain List → Manage → Advanced DNS
- Google Domains: DNS → Custom records
- Cloudflare: DNS → Records

### Step 3: Verify connection

1. Wait **15–30 minutes** for DNS propagation (can take up to **48 hours**).
2. Click **Verify Connection**.

If verification fails:

- Wait longer
- Double-check records for typos
- Ensure the record values match your dashboard

### Step 4: Generate SSL certificate

Once verified:

1. Click **Generate SSL**.
2. Wait **2–5 minutes**.
3. Your site will be accessible via HTTPS.

## What SSL is (and why it matters)

- Secures your website (`https://`)
- Encrypts visitor data
- Required for many payment setups
- Can improve SEO ranking

## Troubleshooting

### “Records are not updated”

- DNS can take up to 48 hours—wait and retry.
- Confirm A records are correct and saved.

### SSL generation fails

- Verify the domain first.
- Wait a few minutes and try again.
- Contact support if it persists.

### Domain shows “not verified”

- Re-check DNS values and names (`@`, `www`).
- Wait for propagation and re-verify.
