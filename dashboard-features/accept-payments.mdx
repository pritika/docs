Set up payment gateways to accept payments through your website.

## Prerequisites

- **Paid subscription** (not available on free plan)
- A payment provider account: PayPal, Stripe, or Razorpay
- Recommended: a custom domain + SSL (especially for live payments)

## How to access

Navigate to **Dashboard → [Your Website] → Accept Payments**.

## Supported payment methods

You can configure:

1. PayPal
2. Stripe
3. Razorpay

Important:

- You can save credentials for multiple providers, but **only one payment method can be active at a time**.

## PayPal setup

### One-time payments (basic)

1. Expand **PayPal**.
2. Enter your PayPal account **Email**.
3. Click **Save**.
4. Click **Activate**.

### Recurring payments (advanced)

If you enable recurring payments, you’ll need API credentials from PayPal Developer.

1. Enable **recurring payments**.
2. Get your **Client ID** and **Secret Key** from [PayPal Developer](https://developer.paypal.com) (Live mode).
3. Paste credentials into the dashboard fields.
4. Click **Save**, then **Activate**.

## Stripe setup

### Get your Stripe secret key

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Developers → API keys
3. Copy your **Secret key** (use Live keys for real payments)

### Configure in Butternut

1. Expand **Stripe**.
2. Paste the **Secret key**.
3. Click **Save**, then **Activate**.

## Razorpay setup

### Get your Razorpay credentials

1. Go to [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com)
2. Settings → API Keys
3. Copy **Key ID** and **Key Secret**

### Configure in Butternut

1. Expand **Razorpay**.
2. Enter **Key ID** and **Key Secret**.
3. Click **Save**, then **Activate**.

## Save vs Activate

- **Save** stores credentials but does not enable payments.
- **Activate** makes the method live and deactivates any other method.

Recommended workflow:

1. Enter credentials
2. Save
3. Activate
4. Test a transaction

## Security notes

- Never share or publish secret keys.
- Don’t use test keys in production.
- Rotate keys if you suspect compromise.

## Troubleshooting

### “Unable to activate payment method”

- Check credentials are correct (no extra spaces).
- Confirm the provider account is in live mode and fully set up.
- Verify SSL is enabled on your site.

### Payments not working on the website

- Confirm the method shows **Activated**.
- Confirm domain + SSL are active.
- Check provider dashboards for errors.
