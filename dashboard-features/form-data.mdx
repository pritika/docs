View and manage submissions from custom forms on your website (contact forms, newsletter forms, surveys, etc.).

## Prerequisites

- **Paid subscription** (not available on free plan)
- At least one form element on your website

## How to access

Navigate to **Dashboard → [Your Website] → Form Data**.

## What you’ll see

- Forms grouped by **form name/label**
- Submission counts per form
- A table of submissions (rows) with each field as a column
- Timestamps and any captured emails

If there are no submissions, you may see **“No data available.”**

## Rename / label forms

Forms can appear with technical names (for example, `contact-form-1`).

To rename:

1. Click the edit (pencil) icon next to the form name.
2. Enter a friendly label (for example, “Contact Form”, “Newsletter Signups”).
3. Click **Save**.

## Export submissions

1. Expand the form you want.
2. Click **Export**.
3. A CSV downloads (often named `data.csv`).

Use exports to back up data, import to a CRM, or run analysis.

## Email notifications (per form)

For each form, you may be able to:

- Toggle notification emails on/off
- Choose which email receives notifications

## Best practices

- Review submissions regularly and respond quickly.
- Export periodically for backups.
- Use clear labels so teams can find the right form.

## Troubleshooting

### “No data available” but you expect submissions

- Submit a test entry and refresh.
- Confirm the website is published.
- Confirm you’re viewing the correct website in the dashboard.

### Export not downloading

- Ensure there are submissions.
- Check browser download permissions or try another browser.

### Form not appearing

- The form may not be fully configured.
- Submit a test entry and wait a few minutes, then refresh.
