## Enable the chatbot

1. Click **Enable Chatbot** (top right).
2. Wait ~30–60 seconds while the chatbot trains on your website content.
3. The chatbot becomes available to visitors.

## Tabs overview

### Tab: Edit

Configure how the chatbot looks and behaves.

#### Chatbot settings

- **Popup title**: label shown on the chatbot launcher (for example: “Chat with us”).
- **Chat window title**: title at the top of the chat window.
- **Description**: welcome text (for example: “How can I help you?”).

#### Logo / avatar

#### Guidelines and training

Use this to improve guidelines over time.
