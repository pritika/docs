Configure the email address where contact form submissions are sent.

## Prerequisites

- **Paid subscription** (not available on free plan)
- A contact form on your website

## How to access

Navigate to **Dashboard → [Your Website] → Contact Us**.

## Set your contact email

1. Expand the main section (“Enter the email where you'd like to receive contact form submissions…”).
2. Enter your email address in the **Email** field.
   - The dashboard may normalize the email to lowercase automatically.
3. Click **Save**.

The change takes effect immediately.

## How it works (visitor flow)

1. A visitor submits your contact form (name/email/message).
2. Butternut processes the submission.
3. An email is sent to your configured address.
4. You reply to the visitor and follow up.

## Testing

1. Visit your live website.
2. Submit a test message through the contact form.
3. Check your inbox within 1–2 minutes.

If you don’t see it:

- Check spam/junk
- Confirm the email address is correct
- Retry after a few minutes

## Multiple recipients (workarounds)

Currently, one email is configured here. If multiple people need to receive submissions:

- Use a shared inbox (for example, `info@...`)
- Set up forwarding rules in your email provider
- Use a distribution list/group email

## Troubleshooting

### Emails going to spam

- Mark the message as “Not spam”
- Add the sender to contacts
- Create a filter to route submissions to a folder

### Delay in receiving emails

- Normal: 1–2 minutes (up to ~5 minutes can happen)
- Check your email provider status if delays persist

### “Website not live yet”

Some dashboards require an active subscription and a published site to deliver reliably.
