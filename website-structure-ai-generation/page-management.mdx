Effective page management is essential for organising a multi-page website and ensuring that your content is accessible and professional. These features are primarily accessed through the **Pages** icon in the website editor’s sidebar.

## Adding new pages from templates

For multi-page websites, you can expand your site structure using the **Add Page** tab within the Page Manager.

### Template selection

You can choose from **15+ pre-built templates**, including:

- About Us
- Contact Us
- Services
- Team
- FAQ
- Pricing
- Testimonials

### The process

1. Select your desired template card.
2. Enter a custom title (required for blank pages).
3. Click **Add Page**.

### AI generation and credits

Once initiated, the system performs a credit check and then uses AI to generate the page content and layout automatically.

### Outcome

After generation, the editor automatically redirects you to the new page so you can begin customising the content.

## Modifying page titles and slugs (URLs)

Manage page details through the **Manage Pages** tab, which displays a scrollable list of every page currently in your site architecture.

### Editing titles

- Click the pencil icon next to a page title to enable inline editing.
- The system auto-saves the new title as soon as you click away from the field, updating your site navigation instantly.

### Editing slugs

- Click directly on the URL (slug) text to edit it.
- The system validates the format, updates the link, and refreshes the page to apply the change.

## Toggling page visibility

The Manage Pages tab lets you control which pages appear in your website’s navigation menu without deleting them.

### Visibility icons

Each page entry includes an eye icon indicating its current status:

- **Green eye**: visible in navigation
- **Grey eye**: hidden from navigation

Clicking the icon toggles the state instantly.

## Deleting pages permanently

If a page is no longer needed, you can remove it entirely from the site.

### Removal process

1. Click the trash icon on the page card in the Manage Pages list.
2. Read the warning dialog: **“Pages once deleted cannot be restored”.**
3. Confirm to permanently delete the page.

### Finalisation

Once confirmed, the page is permanently deleted from the database and removed from the site’s navigation and architecture.

## Analogy for page management (Digital office building)

Think of your website as a **digital office building**:

- Adding a page is like hiring a contractor to instantly build a new room (like a conference room or lobby) based on a standard blueprint.
- Modifying titles and slugs is like changing the sign on the door and updating the office directory.
- Toggling visibility is like locking the door to the public while keeping the room’s contents intact.
- Deleting a page is like demolishing the room entirely to clear space on your floor plan.
