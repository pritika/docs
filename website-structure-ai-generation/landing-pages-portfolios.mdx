Butternut provides a dedicated single-page website experience designed specifically for Landing Pages and Portfolios. Unlike multipage sites, these focus all content onto a single page to drive specific user actions.

## Selecting conversion-focused modes

When creating a landing page, you can select from several conversion-focused modes. These modes act as “types” that instruct the AI to use specific sections and prompts tailored to your goals.

### Available modes

- **Course**: Designed to showcase educational content and enrolment.
- **Booking**: Focused on scheduling services or appointments.
- **Sales Funnel**: Structured to guide visitors through a specific purchasing journey.
- **Lead Magnet**: Built to capture user information (such as emails) in exchange for an offer.
- **Generic**: A versatile option for standard landing page needs.

### How it works

The system uses type-specific planning prompts (for example, `LEAD_MAGNET_LANDINGPAGE_SECTION_PROMPT` or `BOOKING_LANDINGPAGE_SECTION_PROMPT`) to ensure the generated sections—such as features, testimonials, and Call-to-Action (CTA) blocks—align with the intended conversion goal.

## Providing portfolio-specific data

For a personal brand or resume site, Portfolio mode lets you input specific data that the AI incorporates into a professional narrative.

### Inputs you can provide

- **Resume text**: Your professional history and skills. The AI uses a resume/portfolio planning prompt to build sections around this content.
- **Professional links**: Add `portfolioLinks` to connect your social media, GitHub, LinkedIn, or personal projects.
- **Personal images**: Upload a `portfolioImage` (such as a headshot) to be used as a primary visual across the page.
- **Resume URL**: Link directly to a hosted version of your CV.

## The generation process

Once you provide your data and select a mode, the background generator performs several automated steps:

1. **Section planning**: Plans **5–8** content sections (for example, a hero banner, benefits, pricing, and FAQs) based on the selected mode.
2. **Parallel generation**: Each section’s HTML (including styles and scripts) is generated in parallel to reduce wait time.
3. **Cohesive styling**: A single theme/style JSON is applied across all sections so the page has a unified, professional look.
4. **Credit consumption**: On completion, your account is debited based on the number of sections generated.

## Analogy for landing pages vs portfolios

Think of a landing page as a highly trained salesperson at a pop-up stall: they have one specific goal (like getting you to sign up for a course or book a time) and they guide you through a single, focused conversation.

A portfolio is like a curated digital gallery of your best work. Instead of selling a product, it “sells” you by using your resume and links to show visitors exactly what you are capable of.

Both live on a single “stage” (page) to ensure the visitor never gets lost.
