Generating a new website with Butternut AI is a streamlined process that uses your specific business context to build a tailored online presence. This guide covers how to define your brand, choose a design direction, and select the right structure for your needs.

## Defining brand identity and business context

The first step in creating your website is providing the AI with the core identity of your business.

- **Brand name (organization name)**: Provide your official brand or site name. This name is used to populate headers, footers, and brand-specific copy throughout the site.
- **Industry keywords**: Enter keywords or a short description that explains what your business is and what it offers. These keywords act as the foundation for the AI to:
  - Generate relevant text
  - Select appropriate template sections
  - Fetch high-quality images from the platform’s image pool

## Setting design direction and page structures

To ensure the website matches your aesthetic preferences and functional requirements, you can specify the look-and-feel and the specific pages you need.

### Design direction

You can define a design direction to influence the mood of the site. For example:

- Minimal
- Luxury
- Premium
- Dark
- Editorial

The AI uses this direction to choose consistent colours, typography, and a cohesive visual theme for all generated pages.

### Requested page structures

If you have a specific layout in mind, you can define a requested structure. For example:

- Home + Services + Pricing + Contact

The generator will prioritise these page types so the navigation matches your needs.

## Choosing your website type

Butternut supports two primary website formats depending on your marketing goals:

| Feature       | Multipage website (default)                                    | Landing-page-only                                                       |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structure     | Includes a Home page plus several supporting pages.            | A single, long-scrolling page (Portfolio or Lead Magnet style).         |
| Core pages    | Services, About/Clients, Contact, and Blog.                    | None (all content exists in sections on the home page).                 |
| Section count | Varied across multiple pages.                                  | Typically 5–8 focused content sections (Hero, FAQ, Testimonials, etc.). |
| Legal pages   | Automatically generates Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions. | Standard legal pages are typically omitted in the single-page flow.     |

## What happens after you click Generate?

- **Instant access**: The system creates a website record and returns a usable site almost immediately, allowing you to enter the editor while the AI continues its work.
- **Background progress**: For multipage sites, a background job continues to generate the additional sections and pages you requested. You’ll see navigation and content populate progressively as the AI finishes each section.
- **Completion**: Once the background work is finalised, the site is marked as complete and the AI-generated content is ready for your final edits in the dashboard.

## Analogy for website generation (Professional architect)

Think of the AI generator as a **professional architect**:

- Defining your brand and keywords is like handing the architect your business card and a list of services.
- Setting the design direction is like telling them you want a “modern glass office” or a “cosy wooden cottage.”
- Choosing between multipage or landing page is like deciding if you need a full office complex with separate rooms for every department, or a single high-tech studio where everything happens in one open space.

Regardless of the size, the architect ensures the foundation and style are perfectly aligned with your brand.
