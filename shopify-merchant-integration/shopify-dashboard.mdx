The Shopify Dashboard serves as a central hub for merchants to transform their product listings into professional marketing assets using AI. The integration ensures that store data and billing are synchronised seamlessly with the Butternut AI service.

## Browsing synced product catalogs and generation status

The Products page is the main dashboard where your Shopify store products are automatically synced and displayed.

### Catalog browsing

Products are presented in an organised table featuring thumbnails, titles, and basic information.

- **Pagination**: The catalog is paginated, showing **10 products per page** for easier browsing.

### Generation status

Once you select a product and initiate generation, the system provides real-time feedback:

- **Loading indicators**: A loading state is shown while the AI creates images based on your product details.
- **Gallery management**: Successful generations appear in the **Generated Images** gallery, which displays up to **50 images per page** with details such as:
  - Product name
  - Category
  - Creation date
- **Error handling**: If an issue occurs during the process, the dashboard displays clear error messages to help you troubleshoot.

## Managing subscription plans and monthly credits

Merchant subscriptions and usage are managed through the Pricing & Billing page, which links directly to your Shopify account for payment confirmation.

### Merchant-specific plans

- **Free plan**: Includes 5 images per month and standard quality generation.
- **Starter plan ($10/month)**: Provides 75 images per month, custom prompts, and priority support.
- **Pro plan ($25/month)**: Includes 200 images per month, premium AI models, and bulk generation capabilities.

### Credit system

Credits follow a simple rule:

- **1 credit = 1 generated image**

Credits reset monthly according to your billing cycle and **do not roll over** to the next month.

### Usage monitoring

The Usage Dashboard includes:

- A visual progress bar showing usage percentage and total images allocated versus used
- A **Usage History** view (toggle) with a detailed transaction record of:
  - Every image generated
  - Every credit added

### Overages and cancellations

- If you exceed your plan’s limit, an overage fee of **$0.20 per additional image** applies:
  - **Starter cap**: $50
  - **Pro cap**: $100
- If you cancel or downgrade, overage charges are automatically calculated and added to your final Shopify bill.

## Analogy for Shopify integration (Digital photo studio)

Think of the Shopify Dashboard as a **digital photo studio** attached to your warehouse:

- Browsing the catalog is like walking through your warehouse aisles (the synced product list) to pick which items need a photo shoot.
- Managing credits is like having a monthly film allowance:
  - You get a fresh roll of film every month (reset credits).
  - If you don’t use it, you can’t save it for later (no rollover).
  - If you need extra, you can pay a small fee per additional “snapshot” (overages) that’s added to your monthly rent (Shopify bill).
