The Product Image Tools within the Shopify integration allow merchants to transform standard store thumbnails into high-quality, professional marketing assets using AI. This process is managed through the Shopify Dashboard and the Generated Images gallery.

## Generating professional product images

The generation process leverages the Gemini image generation model to create studio-quality visuals, including “virtual try-ons” for wearables or “product placement” in realistic scenes.

### 1) Select your product

Navigate to the Products page, which displays your synced Shopify catalog.

### 2) Initiate generation

Browse your catalog and select a specific product. The AI uses the existing Shopify product details and thumbnails as context for the new generation.

### 3) Real-time feedback

- While the AI generates, you will see a loading indicator on the dashboard.
- If you have insufficient credits, the system returns an error before generation begins.
  - **1 credit = 1 image**

### 4) Review results

Once complete, the new images are added to your **Generated Images** gallery, which displays up to **50 images per page** in a grid layout.

## Customising & refining generations

If the initial result isn’t perfect, use **Edit & Regenerate**:

- Open the image card in the gallery and describe specific changes (for example, “make the lighting warmer” or “change to a tech startup style”).
- The AI generates a new variation while keeping the original product intact.

## Downloading images for store use

After generating your professional assets, you can export them to your device for use on your Shopify storefront, social media, or advertisements.

### 1) Open the image details modal

Click any image in the gallery. The modal displays metadata including:

- AI model used
- Prompt instruction
- Aspect ratio

### 2) Download to device

Click **Download** in the modal.

### 3) Saving process

The image typically opens in a new tab, allowing you to save it directly to your device.

### 4) File management

Each download is automatically named according to your product name (for example, `product_name-index.jpg`) for easier organisation.

## Analogy for product image tools (Virtual photo studio)

Think of this system as a **virtual photo studio**:

- Your Shopify thumbnails are like the raw products sitting in a crate.
- The AI acts as both the photographer and the set designer, instantly placing your product into a professional studio with perfect lighting and backgrounds.
- Once the “photo shoot” is over, downloading the image is like picking up your high-resolution prints from the developer—ready to be displayed in your shop window.
