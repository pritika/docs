The Theme & Typography tools within the Butternut AI editor allow you to define the visual soul of your website. By managing colours and fonts through a centralized design system, you ensure that every page remains cohesive and professional.

## Browsing and applying pre-built colour palettes

You can access Theme settings via the colour palette icon in the website editor’s sidebar.

### Theme categories

To simplify selection, palettes are grouped into categories such as:

- Modern (vibrant)
- Classic (timeless)
- Bold (high-contrast)
- Minimal (neutral)
- Dark/Light modes

### Real-time preview

Clicking any theme card instantly applies those colours across your entire website, so you can see changes in real time as you browse.

### Comprehensive application

A single palette updates multiple design variables at once, including:

- Primary and secondary brand colours
- Accents
- Backgrounds
- Surface areas (like cards)
- Text
- Button states

## Generating custom themes with AI

If the pre-built options don’t match your vision, you can use AI Theme Generation to create a bespoke palette from a text description.

### Descriptive prompts

Enter a specific mood or industry-related instruction, for example:

- “Professional blue for a law firm”
- “Warm and welcoming for a bakery”
- “Tech startup with purple accents”

### Iterative refinement

You can click **Generate** multiple times to see different variations based on your prompt until you find the right match.

### Saving your selection

Once satisfied:

- Click **Save Theme** to permanently store the palette in your website configuration.
- Or click **Clear Theme** to revert to your previous settings.

## Selecting typography combinations

Font settings, located under the **Ff** icon in the sidebar, let you manage the three pillars of website typography.

### Font categories

- **Primary font (Body)**: Used for paragraphs and general descriptions (e.g., Inter, Open Sans).
- **Secondary font (Headings)**: Applied to all titles from H1 to H6 (e.g., Montserrat, Playfair Display).
- **Special font (Accents)**: Reserved for buttons, labels, and highlight elements (e.g., Oswald, Bebas Neue).

### Pre-paired combinations

For a guaranteed professional look, you can select from font pairings designed for visual harmony. Notable combinations include:

- Modern (Inter + Montserrat)
- Elegant (Playfair Display + Lato)
- Tech (Space Grotesk + Inter)

### Live font preview

As with colours, font changes apply instantly to headlines, buttons, and forms so you can test readability across sections before saving.

## Analogy for theme & typography (Interior design)

Setting your website’s theme and typography is like interior designing a new office:

- Choosing a pre-built palette is like picking a pre-coordinated furniture set from a catalogue.
- AI generation is like telling a designer you want the room to feel “industrial and sleek” and having them pick the exact paint codes for you.
- Typography acts as the furniture itself—headings are the large statement pieces (like a boardroom table), while the body font is the comfortable, reliable seating used throughout the building.

Consistent themes ensure that no matter which room (page) a visitor enters, they know they are still in your office.
