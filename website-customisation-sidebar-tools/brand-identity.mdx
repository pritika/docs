Brand Identity refers to the visual and textual elements that represent your business across your website. Within the Butternut editor, you can manage these core assets to ensure your site remains professional and on-brand.

## Updating the business organisation name

The Organisation Name is the official title of your brand or site. It is used by the AI to populate key areas of your website, including headers, footers, and brand-specific copy.

### How to update

- **Single-page sites**: Click the **Brand** icon in the left-hand sidebar.
- **Multi-page sites**: Manage this via **General Settings**.

### Saving changes

Enter your name into the text input field.

Unlike some other editor features, updating the business name **requires clicking Save** to apply the change to your database (it does not auto-save).

- **Maximum size**: 5MB

## Uploading and managing favicons

A favicon is the small icon that appears in the browser tab next to your website’s title, helping users identify your site when they have multiple tabs open.

### File requirements

- **Supported format**: PNG
- **Maximum size**: 5MB

### Recommendations

For best clarity, use a **16×16** or **32×32** pixel image.

### Management

Similar to logos, you can upload your file via the Brand or Settings panel to preview how it will appear in a browser tab.

## Analogy for brand identity (Physical storefront)

Think of your website as a **physical storefront**:

- Updating your organisation name is like hanging the main sign above the door.
- Your logo is the unique brand mark printed on your windows and shopping bags.
- The favicon is like a small branded flag flying on the roof—it’s a tiny detail, but it helps customers spot your building from a distance in a crowded street.
