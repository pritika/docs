Butternut AI provides a multi-layered support system designed to help you build, edit, and manage your website effectively. These tools are primarily accessed via the Website Editor Sidebar, located on the left side of your screen.

## Browsing video and text tutorials

The platform offers both visual and written educational resources to guide you through the website-building process.

- **Categories**: Browse topics such as:
  - Getting Started
  - Adding Content
  - Design Customisation

## Interacting with the ChatAI Assistant

The ChatAI Assistant (Astronaut icon) acts as a context-aware co-pilot while you edit.

### Context-aware help

ChatAI opens as a persistent floating window (typically bottom-right) so it can stay active while you move between pages. It is aware of your current page and sections, enabling more specific guidance.

### Capabilities

- **Content generation**: Ask it to write headlines, generate paragraphs, or suggest Call-to-Action (CTA) text.
- **Editing assistance**: Improve existing text, fix grammar, and adjust tone (for example, more professional or more friendly).
- **Feature guidance**: Ask “how do I…” questions to get step-by-step instructions for editor features.

## Analogy for help & assistance (Learning to fly)

Think of Butternut’s support system like learning to fly a plane:

- Video and text tutorials are your flight manual and training videos—they build the foundation you need before taking off.
- ChatAI is your co-pilot—it can help write text or give immediate guidance on what to do while you’re in the air.
- Live support chat is air traffic control—the experts you call for technical emergencies or complex issues that need a human touch.
